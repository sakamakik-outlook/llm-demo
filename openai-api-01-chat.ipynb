    "What is ChatGPT?\n",
    "ChatGPT is an app built by OpenAI. Using the GPT language models, it can answer your questions, write copy, draft emails, hold a conversation, explain code in different programming languages, translate natural language to code, and moreâ€”or at least try toâ€”all based on the natural language prompts you feed it. It's a chatbot, but a really, really good one.\n",

    "Image from ChatGPT\n",
    "While it's cool to play around with if, say, you want to write a Shakespearean sonnet about your pet or get a few ideas for subject lines for some marketing emails, it's also good for OpenAI. It's a way to get a lot of data from real users and serves as a fancy demo for the power of GPT, which could otherwise feel a little fuzzy unless you were deep into machine learning. (That data collection got ChatGPT blocked in Italy in early 2023, though the Italian regulators' concerns have now been resolved.)\n",
    "Right now, ChatGPT offers two GPT models. The default, GPT-3.5, is less powerful but available to everyone for free. The more advanced GPT-4 is limited to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, and even they only get a limited number of questions every day. (It's 25 messages every three hours at present, but that could change.)\n",
    "One of ChatGPT's big features is that it can remember the conversation you're having with it. This means it can glean context from whatever you've asked it previously and then use that to inform its conversation with you. You're also able to ask for reworks and corrections, and it will refer back to whatever you'd been discussing before. It makes interacting with the AI feel like a genuine back-and-forth. \n",
    "If you want to really get a feel for it, go and spend five minutes playing with ChatGPT now (it's free!), and then come back to read about how it works. \n",
    "How does ChatGPT work?\n",
    "This humongous dataset was used to form a deep learning neural network [...] modeled after the human brainâ€”which allowed ChatGPT to learn patterns and relationships in the text data [...] predicting what text should come next in any given sentence. \n",
    "ChatGPT works by attempting to understand your prompt and then spitting out strings of words that it predicts will best answer your question, based on the data it was trained on. While that might sound relatively simple, it belies the complexity of what's going on under the hood. \n",
    "Supervised vs. unsupervised learning\n",
    "Let's actually talk about that training. The P in GPT stands for \"pre-trained,\" and it's a super important part of why GPT is able to do what it can do. \n",
    "Before GPT, the best performing AI models used \"supervised learning\" to develop their underlying algorithms. They were trained with manually-labeled data, like a database with photos of different animals paired with a text description of each animal written by humans. These kinds of training data, while effective in some circumstances, are incredibly expensive to produce. Even now, there just isn't that much data suitably labeled and categorized to be used to train LLMs.\n",
    "Instead, GPT employed generative pre-training, where it was given a few ground rules and then fed vast amounts of unlabeled dataâ€”near enough the entire open internet. It was then left \"unsupervised\" to crunch through all this data and develop its own understanding of the rules and relationships that govern text. \n",
    "Of course, you don't really know what you're going to get when you use unsupervised learning, so GPT is also \"fine-tuned\" to make its behavior more predictable and appropriate. There are a few ways this is done (which I'll get to), but it often uses forms of supervised learning\n",
